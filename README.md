BLOCKCHAIN PROJECTS
The first project is an implementation of IPFS protocol wherein files are divided into chunks of 4KB are identified by CIDs. It additionally checks for data deduplication with the help of SHA256 hashing technique.
The smart contract implements a smart ride booking DAPP on the Ethereum blockchain which allows users to reverse their payments if necessary, within a 12 minute window from the start of the ride. 
The additional restrictions are that they can only reverse their payments for a maximum of 3 times. However, on paying extra gas fees, they can overcome this condition.
